Atomic Bomb was first tested on July 16, 1945 in the United States of America, and was used in the final period of World War II in two Japanese cities: Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Because of the need to have new weapons in combat and also because the world's greatest powers sought the so-called warlike power, nations that had such power had more political respect, so the bomb was designed to exterminate an entire population, such as occurred in the two Japanese cities, which killed more than 100,000 people instantly, considered the largest civilian population attack in world history.

The people who survived the attack are called "Ribakusha" which means "survivor of the bomb". The Atomic Bomb is an explosive that uses its destructive force in nuclear reactions such as fission or a combination of fission and fusion made of (Uranus and Plutonium) to generate enormous amounts of energy when the nucleus of an atom breaks. Due to the explosion of the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki the flames came, and in some places of these cities they were 5 times hotter than the surface of the Sun. Over time and the advance of new technologies, several weapons more powerful than the bombs were created, for example the Hydrogen Pump, and the Tsar Pump, being this the most powerful bomb in the world, until now.
