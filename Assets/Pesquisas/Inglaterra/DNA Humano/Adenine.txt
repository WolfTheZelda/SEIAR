Present in both DNA and RNA (Ribonucleic Acid), adenine (A) is a nitrogenous base that together with guanine (G) is classified in Purina as a base that has two moderately alkaline rings, different from other bases such as cytosine, thymine and uracil having only one.

The Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff conducted studies on the structure of DNA and found that the amount of concentrated adenine was congenic to thymine which indicated that both adenine and thymine, guanine and cytosine exist in DNA through some inter- constant relationship, which are interconnected by means of hydrogen bonds, this interconnection between bases that makes possible the process of genetic duplication.

Adenine is hydrophobic, that is, not compatible with guanine, it comes from the nucleoside inosine monosfate (IMP) and participates in the process of formation of nucleotides and adenine is very important because it is involved in activities fundamental to cells such as protein synthesis and cellular respiration.

Curiosity:
Previously adenine was cited in books as a vitamin called Vitamin B4, but it is no longer considered a vitamin these days.
