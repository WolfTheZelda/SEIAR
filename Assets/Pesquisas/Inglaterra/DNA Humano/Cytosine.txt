Cytosine is one of the four nitrogenous bases found in both DNA and RNA, the others being adenine (A) and guanine (G).

As with thymine (T), cytosine is classified on the basis of pyrimidine because it has only a slightly alkaline ring and when interconnected with guanine gives rise to three hydrogen bonds that can be transformed into a uracil (U) and other bases to transport genetic data.

The guanine can be part of a nucleotide and as well as guanine (G), adenine (A) and thymine (T), it is present in the double helix is ​​a DNA model proposed by scientists James D. Watson and Francis Crick .

The amount of guanine concentrated in the DNA and equipolente of guanine, what we call Chargaff's relation due to the Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff who discovered this type of interrelationship from studies on the structure of the DNA.

Cytosine is of significant importance because it acts as a genetic data encoder for RNA and DNA molecules.

Curiosity:

It was discovered by German biochemist Ludwig Karl Martin Leonhard Albrecht Kossel in 1894.
