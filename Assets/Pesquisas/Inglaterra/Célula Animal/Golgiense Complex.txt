The Golgi complex or golgiense complex discovered by the Italian Camillo Golgi in 1898 is an organelle present in eukaryotic cells, composed of flattened and stacked membranes called cysts, it is located between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum.

The main functions of the golgi complex are to store, modify and transport the proteins synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, in addition to giving rise to the acrosomes and lysosomes of spermatozoa.
