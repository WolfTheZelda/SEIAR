Centrioles are cytoplasmic organelles that have the shape of tubes, and are found in the vast majority of eukaryotic cells. It is not all cells that have centrioles, plant cells, fungi and prokaryotic cells, for example, do not have this organelle. The centrioles are located near the nucleus of the cells.
In animal cells they are located in a region called centrosomes. The centrioles are formed by microtubules, which are the same structures that form the cytoskeleton of cells and are formed by a protein called tubulin.

Each centriole is composed of 27 microtubules arranged in 9 sets, each set with 3 parallel microtubules attached to each other by adhesive proteins. Centrioles participate in the process of cell division (mitosis and meiosis), in which they duplicate and are responsible for the formation of the achromatic spindle, or meiotic spindle as it is called during meiosis.
The achromatic spindle in turn is responsible for disrupting the chromosomes during the process of cell division so that they are present in the daughter cells. In addition to the achromatic spindle, the centrioles are responsible for the formation of the cilia and the flagella of the cells.

Eyelashes are organelles present in cells that are larger than the flagella, present also in certain protozoa and also in the human trachea, where it has the function of eliminating airborne impurities inhaled with air. The flagella, in turn, are fine filaments that are present in several cells such as algae, animals and protozoa, and are present also in mammals, but only in spermatozoa.
