Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells, they are responsible for generating the necessary energy to the cells through cellular respiration. Mitochondria have two lipoprotein membranes: an inner one that has several folds, in which a large part of the chemical reactions occur in it, and an outer membrane that is responsible for sustaining and coating its organelles. Both the inner and outer membrane are formed by a lipid bilayer related to proteins, which control the entry is the exit of molecules.

The folds of the inner membrane are called mitochondrial ridges, these ridges are extremely important because they increase the surface of the structure, which is of great importance because it is in her that the fundamental processes for aerobic life occur. In addition to the lipoprotein membranes, the mitochondria also have DNA molecules, ribosomes, enzymes and have the capacity of autoduplication, that is, the ability to replicate their DNA. The DNA found in the mitochondria is different from that found in the cell.

Therefore, it is believed that the mitochondria originated by endosymbiosis, which is the theory that some organelles arose from the entry of a prokaryotic organism into some kind of primitive eukaryotic cell. The size, amount, shape, and distribution of mitochondria may vary from cell to cell, they may be of various shapes, they may have a rounded or elongated shape, and adopt a rod-like shape or a shape similar to an egg.

In the human cell for example, there may be from 300 to 500 mitochondria. Curiosities: The mitochondria was discovered by the Belgian cytologist Albert Claude around the year 1974. The word mitochondria comes from the Greek (myth = means filament, chondrion = means particle). The energy used to regulate the temperature of our body is produced by mitochondria. Mitochondria are also present in plant cells.
