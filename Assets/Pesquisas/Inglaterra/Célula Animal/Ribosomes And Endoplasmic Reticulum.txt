Ribosomes:

Ribosomes, also called ribosomes, are imperceptible to the naked eye, measuring about 30 nm in diameter. They are present in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, more specifically in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, chloroplast and endoplasmic reticulum, thus forming the granular endoplasmic reticulum.

The main functions of the ribosomes is to act in the synthesis and production of proteins in the cells, thus possessing thousands of ribosomes in their cytoplasm. This synthesis of proteins is controlled by RNA, formed in the genetic transition on the command of DNA, through chemical union of amino acids that union has the name of peptide bond.

Endoplasmic reticulum:

The endoplasmic reticulum discovered in 1945 by the Belgian cytologist Albert Claude, is a membranous organelle exclusive to eukaryotic cells, consisting of vesicles and flat tubules, is formed from the invagination of the plasma membrane

The endoplasmic reticulum has two forms, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (REL), and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), which are:

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (REL) does not have ribosomes attached to its surface because it appears to be a smooth composite of cylindrical tubules, its main function and to participate in the production of lipid molecules and hormones, another process that occurs in REL is the modification of some molecules with the goal of facilitating their excretion.

Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) has ribosomes attached to its surface, with a rough appearance. With these ribosomes the function is to synthesize and aid the production of proteins, as well as to communicate directly to the cell nucleus.
