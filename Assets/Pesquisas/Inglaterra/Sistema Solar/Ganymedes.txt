Largest natural satellite of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, Ganymede is larger than the planet mercury in terms of size. The hypothesis of an ocean hidden in Ganymede has already been seen as an explanation for Ganymede's strong magnetic field.

In 1995 the Galileo spacecraft arrived in Ganymede allowing a detailed study on the satellite. Its gravity is 1,428 m / s². Ganymede's day lasts more than 7 days from Earth and its atmosphere is very rarefied, but analyzes of the Galileo spacecraft showed the presence of oxygen and argon.
