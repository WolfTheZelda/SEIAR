The planet's only natural satellite, the moon is the fifth largest celestial body beyond earth that humans have ever visited. The interaction of Earth-Moon gravity has many other interesting consequences: the effect of the tide that delays the rotation of the earth, agates the earth's moon 3.9 cm per year; and it is this gravitational interaction that is responsible for the rotation of the moon to be synchronous with its translation. The moon's average elevation is 1,622 m / s².

Its atmosphere is composed of:

Helium - 25%
Neon - 25%
Hydrogen - 23%
Argon - 20%
