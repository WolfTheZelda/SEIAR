Smaller than the moon, Europe is made mostly of silicate rock and features a water-ice crust and an iron-nickel core. The youth and apparent smoothness of the surface of Europe took apparent from the surface of Europe have led to the hypothesis that there is an ocean beneath it, which could harbor extraterrestrial life. A study by NASA (North American Space Agency) has proved that Europe is the most likely place to have life off the ground.

Research has shown that there may be sufficient oxygen and hydrogen for the formation of life in Europe. A study published by Geophysical Research Letters, made the discovery that the production of oxygen both on earth and in Europe is ten times greater than that of hydrogen. The gravity of Europe is 1,315 m / s², Europe has very fine atmosphere with 1x10-11 bar composed by oxygen.
