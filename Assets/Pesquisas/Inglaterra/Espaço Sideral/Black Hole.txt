Black holes are localities in space that, due to their absurd amount of concentrated mass and its gravitational force, consumes everything around it, to such a level that even light does not escape. This is due to this "devourer" possessing such a large amount of mass concentrated in such a small zone that its density causes a change in space-time, such that even the light itself with its enormous velocity does not escape, which supposedly may be related to a type of black circle in its center.

Black Holes are divided into two types:

Estelares - Formed after the death of a star (Supernova).

Supermassive - They originated hypothetically in the birth of the universe.

Contrary to what some people think, the Sun will not turn into a Black Hole, because it does not have enough mass, but in a Red Giant.
Over the years, renowned scholars such as Albert Einstein, Karl Schwarzschild, and Stephen Hawking have conducted studies that were in fact and still of absolute importance for the in-depth study of Black Holes, and Karl proved their existence in 1915.

Curiosities:

According to a discovery made by Beijing University in China, in another galaxy lies a Hole that hold an amount of light about 420 trillion to the Sun.

In the Milky Way lies a supermassive Black Hole that, according to estimates, holds 4,000,000 times the mass of the Sun, called Sagittarius A, located near the constellations Scorpius and Sagittarius.

Recently, the Universe's fastest-growing Black Hole, called the QSO SMSS J215728.21-360215.1, was discovered by astronomers from the ANU (National University of Australia).
