The Supernova is a kind of star that represents the death of a star. A star always appears in a cloud of dust and big, cold gas that is usually next to other stars of a galaxy. For the formation of a star to start, there must be some kind of cloud disturbance, such as the explosion of a Supernova.

After the turmoil, lumps are formed inside the cloud, and due to temperature and mass constantly increasing, lumps begin to collapse and attract more and more matter to its interior until a nucleus is formed, called Protoestrela. However, the Protoestrella continues to heat itself, and through gravity it attracts matter to its nucleus until it stabilizes, if the nucleus has enough mass it forms a star.

Every star is made up primarily of hydrogen and helium, it consumes that fuel until it runs out, and so, until the hydrogen is completely consumed. When this happens the star dies, but it is not in all cases that it will become a Supernova, the transformation depends on the size of the star. A star must have a mass higher than the Sun so that it becomes a Supernova when the hydrogen runs out. When this happens, the star begins to transform the helium into carbon by the fusion process. This process is the same as in smaller stars, but such a large star has enough mass to melt the carbon with heavier elements such as iron and sulfur.

As soon as the core is cast in iron it will collapse due to its gravity and begin to fall on itself, the outside of the former star is thrown violently in the space, which generates a shock that can cause the appearance of several other stars in other galaxies. The core becomes so thick and dense in a short time, that a small part of it would be extremely heavy. In its nucleus the electrons and the protons are united and they originate neutrons, in this stage it happens to be called neutron star. For the dead star to form a black hole instead of a neutron star, it needs to be about thirty times larger than the sun.
