Alpha Centauri is the star system closest to the Solar System, with a distance of 4.37 light years.

It consists of three stars: Alpha Centauri A (also known as Rigil Kentaurus) and Alpha Centauri B, which together constitute the binary star Alpha Centauri AB, a small red dwarf, is Alpha Centauri C (also known as Next Centauri) that is surface bound gravitationally.

Viewed by the naked eye, its two main components are shown as a singular point of light that has a visible visual magnitude of -0.27, constituting the most luminous star in the southern constellation of the Centaurus constellation and is the third brightest star in the night sky, being surpassed only by the stars Canopus and Sirius. Alpha Centauri A has 1.11 mass and luminosity 1.52 times greater than that of the Sun, while Alpha Centauri B is cooler and smaller, having 0.94 the mass of the Sun and 0.50 times its luminosity.

Next Centauri is the star with closest proximity to the Sun, being at a distance of 4.24 light years, not visible to the naked eye.

The current separation between Next and Alpha Centauri AB is 13,000 AU, which is the equivalent of 430 times the orbital radius of the planet Neptune. In the year 2016, Centauri B was discovered, an extrasolar planet terrestrial in the habitable zone of Next Centauri.
