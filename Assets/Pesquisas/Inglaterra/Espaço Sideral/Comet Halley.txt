Officially designated 1P / Halley, Halley's comet is a periodic comet, every 74-79 years can be seen from Earth. Its last appearance was in 1986 and its return is predicted for 2061. It is already known from 240 a.C, and from 1059 a.C possibly. The most famous appearance of Comet Halley was in 1066 AD, shortly before the Battle of Hastings. Comet Halley was named after Edmund Halley, who calculated its orbit. The comet had brilliant appearances in 1835 and 1910.

Five spacecraft from the USSR, Europe and Japan were launched to meet the comet in 1986. One of the NASA satellites was directed to monitor the effect of the solar wind on Comet Halley. On March 19, 1986, an example of the Halley Comet's radius structure was captured at the Mount Wilson / Las Campanas observatories. Edmund Halley, in his observations, proved that the characteristics of Halley's Comet coincided with the characteristics described by Poetrix Apainus in 1531 and with those observed in Prague in 1607 by Johannes Kepler.

Then it was completed by Edmund Halley, who corresponded to the same object that returned every 76 years. The orbit was then estimated and its reappearance was predicted for the year 1757. Its orbit is very elliptical, its perihelion (less distance from the body to which it orbits) is 0.6 AU (AU is a unit astronomical corresponding to 149,598,000 km) between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. The aphelion (greater distance to the Sun) from the comet is 35 AU, almost the same as Pluto.

Halley's comet's tail traverses millions of miles across space and the core is 15 km long, 8 km wide and 8 km in autura, and only 4% of the light it receives is reflected, making it appear white and bright in fact black. The white color seen from Earth is because of the vapor detachment from the comet's nucleus. The vapor that comes off the comet's core is composed of 80% water, 17% carbon monoxide, 3 to 4% carbon dioxide and traces of hydrocarbons. When Comet Halley arrives near the Sun, its temperature can reach 77 ° C. The mass of the Halley comet is 2.2x1014 kg.
