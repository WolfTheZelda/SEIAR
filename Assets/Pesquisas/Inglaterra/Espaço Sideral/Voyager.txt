Voyager 1 is an unmanned probe launched on September 5, 1977 by the United States with the goal of studying the planets Jupiter and Saturn and their moons, it is soon afterwards to continue with a space exploration. The probe was the only human construction to enter interstellar space.

The Voyager 1 probe is currently on a mission, which is the exploration behind the edges of the solar system, in these missions are studied the phenomena called heliopause and the heliosphere, scientists will predict that their communication with the probe will be lost in the 2020s.

It is not so much that is considered the most enduring mission of all, it is more than 20.8 billion km from the sun is distancing itself more and more, beating all records away from the previous probes, it is estimated that it is certain of 140 times farther from the earth than the sun, this is not a great distance on a cosmic scale, but it is a great step to discover more about the mysteries of the universe.

In April of 1979 the probe had its maximum approximation to the planet Jupiter at a distance of approximately 349,000 km of its center, with that was possible the more detailed observation of the rings and moons of Jupiter, where the probe stayed 48 hours near the gaseous planet.
 
The encounter with Saturn was different than expected, with its maximum approximation on November 12, 1980 at a distance of 124,000 km from the surface of the gaseous planet, with its powerful camera found that saturn has rings of complex structures, in addition to the discovery of the atmosphere gassy on Saturn's largest moon Titan. Due to its approaching moon Titan, Titan eventually sent the probe out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending the planetary exploration missions, the probe discovered three Jupiter moons, four on Saturn, eleven on Uranus, five on Neptune , as well as discovering active volcanoes off planet Earth.

Astronomers still have a goal to accomplish, which is to collect more data on the cosmic ray, magnetic field, in addition to plasma that are dropped from dead stars, but this requires time and amount of energy from the remaining plutonium batteries of the probe.

The Voyager probe is equipped with a gold disc, with the purpose of informing our terrestrial habits to some society that finds it, in this disc contains greetings in 55 languages, including Portuguese, 31 songs, and 115 photos.
