Hubble was a telescope launched by NASA on April 24, 1990, is considered the most important telescope of all, by staying in space without atmosphere he can take accurate pictures of the farthest places in the cosmos. Hubble has this name because of the astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble, an important astronomer who discovered that galaxies are moving away from each other at an increasing rate, in addition to discovering that the nebulae are actually mostly galaxies.

Hubble has the ability to detect visible and infrared light, plus its optical system consists of two large mirrors of 2.40 meters in diameter, so it is to observe a large field of view by being characterized as a reflecting telescope. With Hubble astronomers have had a broader view of the universe enabling a greater understanding with the discoveries by the powerful telescope, among its main discoveries are the detection of black holes, collision images of galaxies and planets outside the solar system, and detect thousands of existing galaxies showing just how immense and the universe.
