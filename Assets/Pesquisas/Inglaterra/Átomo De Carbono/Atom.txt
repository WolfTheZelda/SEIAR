It is called the Atom the fundamental unit of matter. Smaller fraction able to identify a chemical element, the Atom is formed by a nucleus, that owns protons and neutrons, and also is formed by electrons that surround the nucleus.
The name comes from the Greek meaning a = no and tomos = divisions. Democritus believed that all materials would have a smaller part and that this part would be indivisible.

The English physicist Joseph John Thompson proposed in 1897 a model that became known as Passion Pudding, where there were both types of charges simultaneously, these charges are known as positive charge and negative charge.
The British physicist James Chadwick discovered in the nucleus in 1932, the existence of particles that have no charge, called neutrons.
New Zealand physicist and chemist Ernest Rutherford proposed in 1911 an atomic model very similar to the Solar System: the nucleus would be the sun, and the electrons would be the planets.

Danish physicist Niels Bohr has broadened Rutherford's model, which proposed that electrons revolved around the nucleus in electronic levels, or layers, without losing energy. In each orbit, the electrons have specific energy: the greater the proximity of the nucleus, the smaller the amount of energy; the greater the distance, the greater the amount of energy of the electron. Nowadays, we know that the subatomic particles that form the atoms are: protons, neutrons, electrons, positrons, quarks, mesons, and neutrinos.

Curiosities:

The Atom is a tiny object in which its diameter is only a few tenths of nanometers.
Nearly 99.94% of the mass of the Atom is concentrated at its core.
The Atom was named after the Greek philosopher Democritus, who lived between 546 and 460 BC.
