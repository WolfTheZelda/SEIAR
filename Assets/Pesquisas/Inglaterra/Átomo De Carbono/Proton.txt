Protons are atomic particles discovered by physicists Ernest Rutherford and Elgen Goldstein through their scientific experiments. Physicist Rutherford confirmed in 1904, in his experiments with hydrogen gas, the presence of positive particles he named protons. Along with neutrons, the protons constitute the atomic nuclei. The proton has a charge of +1, which is the opposite of charge -1 contained in the electron. The proton has a mass about 1,836 times greater than that of an electron. The charge of the proton is 1.6x10-19 C.

The result of the sum of neutrons and protons is called the number of the atomic mass: A = p + n

Protons and neutrons are known as hadrons or nuclei. The atomic number of the chemical elements is determined by the number of protons. They are called isotopes, the elements that have the same number of protons. When the atom loses electrons it gets positively charged because the number of protons increases and they are called cations. A proton is 100,000 times smaller than an entire atom. The protons are located in the nucleus of the atom, along with the neutrons, constituting a dense, massive and compact nucleus, located in the middle of the atom.

The protons are spin fermions -1/2 and are also composed of three quarks of valence, which makes them baryons. The two up quarks and one quark down belonging to the proton are held together by strong force, which is measured by the gluons.
The real mass of a proton is nearly 1.673x10 ^ -27, and its actual electric charge is nearly 1.6.10-16coulombs. In a rapid movement through matter, a proton will slow down because of interactions with nuclei and electrons until it is captured by the electron cloud of an atom. The electrical polarizability of a proton is 1.20 (6) x 10^ -3 fm^3.
