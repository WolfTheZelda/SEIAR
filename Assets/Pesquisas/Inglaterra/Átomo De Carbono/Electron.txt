Electrons are the particles that make up the atom. Electrons are located in the electrosphere of the atom, the electrons move around the nucleus of the atom in electronic layers. British chemist and physicist William Crookes created a sealed glass tube that became known as the Ampule de Crookes in which gases were placed under very low pressures and a negative pole and a positive pole were present at the ends of the ampoule, the electrodes. In 1897 the British physicist Joseph John Thompson, carried out more experiments with the Ampola de Crookes that culminated the discovery of the electrons. Electrons orbit with a certain amount of energy. When an atom receives energy it passes from an orbit with a smaller amount of energy to an orbit with a larger amount of energy, remaining in an excited state.

But this state lasts a short time and quickly, the electron loses the energy received and returns to its ground state.
The electric current is nothing more than an ordered flow of electrons. For example, in metal there are several free electrons that are arranged in a flux within the lattice of the metal by a magnetic or electric field. The mass of the electron is almost 1840 times smaller than the mass of the nucleus. An electron has an electric charge of 1.60x10-19C and has a mass of about 9.11x10-31Kg.

There is a phenomenon of physics that is the result of the emission of one electron from another electron. The electron that is emitted gains the name of electron auger.
